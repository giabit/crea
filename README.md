Conflict Resolution with Equitative Algorithms

This project was co-funded by the Justice Programme of the European Union under grant agreement No. 766463.

The project aims to introduce new mechanisms of dispute resolution as a helping tool in legal procedures for lawyers, mediators and judges with the objective to reach an agreement between the parties; in some situations it could be used directly by citizens. We believe that the new procedure has the potential to deeply change national and cross-border civil proceedings. The final goal is removing differences due to national laws among all EU countries.
